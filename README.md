This game is made in Java using Android Studio since Google is not supporting Eclipse anymore (you can import on Eclipse). The game has been made using LibGDX framework which is also made in pure java.

We have created a Configuration File where you can change all the values in code, and see the result on your game, there you can find all the ids that need to be changed. The online documentation will be updated with the questions of the buyers, to make it even better than it is now. Comes with Admob banners and interstitial ready. It also has youtube tutorials in order to customize and import the game. Buy Fast Tap! and start making money with Android Games!
